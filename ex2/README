# OS Ex. 2

# void siglongjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int val)
siglongjmp restores environment and signal mask saved by sigsetjmp and jumps to the position of sigsetjmp with env.
It then continues execution with the perception of sigset returning val.

# int sigsetjmp(jmp_buf env, int val)
sigsetjmp saves the environment and returns 0 initially. When siglongjmp is called next it returns val, indicating
that the program is restoring the environment again.

# How siglongjmp and sigsetjmp affect masking
sigsetjmp saves the mask and siglongjmp restores it.

# User level threads
User level threads require less overhead than processes, and share the same memory. They are easier to work with, and provide
more control for the application layer than kernel level threads.

# Google Chrome
Advantages include: isolated memory, isolated execution, and the fact that with web browser tabs, the user is usually using 
a small number of tabs and the other tabs don't need to do lots of work in the background on the client's native machine.

Disadvantage: More overhead for creating processes, more memory usage

Note: Google chrome runs on the v8 engine which opperates on a single-threaded eventloop based architechture. So technically 
it is not designed to be multithreaded. Asynchronous execution is done with the eventloop.

# Killing a process
When using kill we use SIGTERM which cleans up the process resources and then kills it.
We use SIGKILL to force kill the process.

# Real time and virtual time
Virtual time is the time measured in CPU clock cycles.
Real time is the total amount of time that has elapsed since the beginning of execution.
